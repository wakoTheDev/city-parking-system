city-parking-system

An AI powered  information system that smoothen the reservation ,allocation and availability checking city parking slots

Problem  statement
Existing parking infrastructure in smart cities is often outdated and unable to handle the changing needs of residents and visitors. 
Drivers waste time searching for available spots, and cities lack the data to optimize parking supply and pricing.

Approach
data collection 
data anlysis
model training
user interface design
api intergration

features to be incoerated in the solution
Real-Time Data Collection
A data collection method that is able to collect data from various parking areas which is reliant to the booking rate and leaving rate 

Intelligent allocation
It will be able to use an AI model to analyse the data collected thus can be able to predict available slots enable reservation and payment thus smoothening parking allocation
AI algorithms analyze the data to dynamically assign and guide drivers to open spots.

Intergrated reservation
Drivers can reserve and pay for parking through a mobile app or website.

Google map api
intergrated is a google map api that will enable Drivers to check the specific location of the parking slot, anable drivers to check for alternative available parking slots closer to the location  they intend park
thus the drivers will not have to park their cars very far from the intended location

Tools inteded to be used include 
javascript,html, css for user interface creation
python
keras api for neural network training
